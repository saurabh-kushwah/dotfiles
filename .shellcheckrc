# disabled. Invoke separately if failures should cause the script to exit.

# We don't use the `set -e` feature in Bash scripts yet.
# We do need the return status as condition for if switches.
# Allow `if command` and `if ! command`.

# SC2311: Bash implicitly disabled set -e for this function invocation because
# it's inside a command substitution. Add set -e; before it or enable inherit_errexit.
